AVIF Viewer
A very simple AVIF image viewer for Android

This application is made possible by libavif.
libavif is released under the BSD license.

It is a very simple, currently only supports viewing in 8-bit mode (If your AVIF image is 10-bit, it will shown as 8 bit)

This is a side project I made to learn stuffs, the code is very messy (and slow), I am not sure I did everything correctly according to any standard(s).

It is based on libavif and dav1d.

Currently it will only work on Android 7.0+ devices with ARM processors (32-bit and 64-bit), Android devices with Intel processor is not supported.

It can save files as 8-bit .jpg into gallery too.

Please use this at your own risk tough, but downloading this app you agree that I am not responsible for anything that happens to you by downloading / using this apps.
